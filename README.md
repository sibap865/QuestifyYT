# YouTube_note_search
This project is helpful for searching notes from Youtube videos using RetrivalQA RAG on YouTube transcripts.

## About the YouTube_note_search chrome extension
* This Chrome extension is useful when you have watched a YouTube video but have not taken notes, which is much needed for revision.
* By using our Chrome extension, you can ask questions about the YouTube video. It will generate useful information only from the video with the help of RAG.

## How does it work?
* It consists of two parts: frontend and backend (two directories, frontend and backend).
* Whenever the user validates the url, the video transcript for that video will be stored in a vector database for easy retrival (it will take a while depending on the video size).
* In backend first url will be validated. 
* If the video is ready to search, user can ask questions about it.
* A LLM retrival chain retrives the relevent results from the retriver and show to end user.
